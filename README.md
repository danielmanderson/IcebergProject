The Iceberg Project
3D Printing Floating Objects

Software is written by members of the Iceberg Project at George Mason University, associated with 
The GMU Math Makerlab and MEGL.  

Current and past members are listed below

These files are part of an ongoing set of code and printables for 3D printing floating objects and understanding stability of floating objects. 

In each folder, there is a corresponding README: 

- PotentialEnergyFloat has Matlab files you will need to analyze a shape with a polygonal cross section.
- DesignFloat has Matlab code for turning an image into a polygonal region in Matlab and OpenSCAD
- openscadstl has a code and stl files for printable objects with fixed cross sections including: square cross sections with and without holes for nails; general polygonal cross sections
- squareloopercode is a special case of PotentialEnergyFloat for the square
