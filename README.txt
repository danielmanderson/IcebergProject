These files are part of an ongoing set of code and printables for 3D printing floating objects and understanding stability of floating objects. 

In each folder, there is a corresponding README: 

-- PotentialEnergyFloat has Matlab files you will need to analyze a shape with a polygonal cross section.

-- figures2points has Matlab code for turning an image into a polygonal region in Matlab and OpenSCAD

-- openscadstl has a code and stl files for printable objects

-- squareloopercode is a special case of PotentialEnergyFloat for the square
